However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information.

On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems.

In the second turn, both attackers were explaining the reason of requesting the billing address previously.

That is, whether it is possible to top BERT with the commonly used or task specific layers, and if this is possible, how to best utilize the pre-trained language models in this situation. In this regards, Peters et al. BIBREF0 investigated how to best adapt the pre-trained model to a specific task, and focused on two different adaptation method,feature extraction and directly fine-tuning the pre-trained model, which corresponding to the strategy finetune-only and the strategy stack-only in Table TABREF1 . On this regard, Peters et al.", "Under our strategy stack-and-finetune, the model training process is divided into two phases, which are described in detail below. In the first phase, the parameters of the pre-training model are fixed, and only the upper-level models added for a specific task is learned. In the second phase, we fine-tune the upper-level models together with the pre-trained language models. We choose this strategy for the following reasons. Pre-training models have been used to obtain more effective word representations through the study of a large number of corpora. In the paradigm proposed in the original work by Devlin et al. BIBREF1 , the author directly trained BERT along with with a light-weighted task-specific head. In our case though, we top BERT with a more complex network structure, using Kaiming initialization BIBREF28 .", "Under the strategy finetune-only, we use only single BERT.In order to adapt to different tasks, we will add a fully connected layer upon BERT. In the sequence labeling task, the BERT word embedding of each word passes through two fully connected layers, and the prediction probability of named entity can be obtained. In the next two verification tasks, we use \u201c[CLS]\u201d for prediction and add two fully connected layers subsequently. Under our strategy stack-and-finetune, we set different learning rates for the two phases. We tried to set the learning rate of the first stage to INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 , and set it to a smaller number in the latter stage, such as INLINEFORM5 , INLINEFORM6 , INLINEFORM7 and INLINEFORM8 . After our experiments, we found that it gets better results while the learning rate is set to 0.001 in the stage of training only the upper model and set to INLINEFORM9 in the later stage.", "We choose this strategy for the following reasons.

In our case though, we top BERT with a more complex network structure, using Kaiming initialization BIBREF28 . If one would fine-tune directly the top models along with the weights in BERT, one is faced with the following dilemma: on the one hand, if the learning rate is too large, it is likely to disturb the structure innate to the pre-trained language models; on the other hand, if the learning rate is too small, since we top BERT with relatively complex models, the convergence of the top models might be impeded. Therefore, in the first phase we fix the weights in the pre-training language models, and only train the model on top of it.", "That is, whether it is possible to top BERT with the commonly used or task specific layers, and if this is possible, how to best utilize the pre-trained language models in this situation.

Thus, hyponyms, which are usually more specific and concrete, should obtain additional frequencies from upper synsets and increase their contributions into the document topics. But the frequencies and contribution of hypernyms into the topic of the document are not changed. And we see the great improvement of the model quality: the kernel uniqueness considerably improves, perplexity decreases to levels comparable with the unigram model, topic coherence characteristics also improve for most collections (Table 2:LDA-Sim+WNsynrel/hyp).", "In the experiments on four English collections, it was shown that the direct implementation of this idea using WordNet synonyms and/or direct relations leads to great degradation of the unigram model.

The human scores also confirm this fact. But if the similarity between phrase components is considered then the quality of topics significantly improves and becomes better than for unigram models (Runs 4, 5). All measures are better. Relational coherence between kernel elements also grows. The number of added phrases is not very essential.", "For each combined model, we ran two experiments with 100 topics and with 200 topics. The generated topics were evaluated by two linguists, who had previously worked on the Islam thesaurus. The evaluation task was formulated as follows: the experts should read the top elements of the generated topics and try to formulate labels of these topics. The labels should be different for each topic in the set generated with a specific model. The experts should also assign scores to the topics' labels:", "In our approach we develop the idea of BIBREF16 that proposed to construct similarity sets between ngram phrases between each other and single words. Phrases and words are included in the same similarity set if they have the same component word, for example, weapon \u2013 nuclear weapon \u2013 weapon of mass destruction; discrimination \u2013 racial discrimination. It was supposed that if expressions from the same similarity set co-occur in the same document then their contribution into the document's topics is really more than it is presented with their frequencies, therefore their frequencies should be increased. In such an approach, the algorithm can \"see\" similarities between different multiword expressions with the same component word."]}

In extreme cases this may also be language that threatens or incites violence, but limiting our definition only to such cases would exclude a large proportion of hate speech. Importantly, our definition does not include all instances of offensive language because people often use terms that are highly offensive to certain groups but in a qualitatively different manner. For example some African Americans often use the term n*gga in everyday language online BIBREF2 , people use terms like h*e and b*tch when quoting rap lyrics, and teenagers use homophobic slurs like f*g as they play video games. Such language is prevalent on social media BIBREF3 , making this boundary condition crucial for any usable hate speech detection system .", "Our results also illustrate how hate speech can be used in different ways: it can be directly send to a person or group of people targeted, it can be espoused to nobody in particular, and it can be used in conversation between people.

We must also study more closely the people who use hate speech, focusing both on their individual characteristics and motivations and on the social structures they are embedded in.", "Consistent with previous work, we find that certain terms are particularly useful for distinguishing between hate speech and offensive language. While f*g, b*tch, and n*gga are used in both hate speech and offensive language, the terms f*ggot and n*gger are generally associated with hate speech. Many of the tweets considered most hateful contain multiple racial and homophobic slurs. While this allows us to easily identify some of the more egregious instances of hate speech it means that we are more likely to misclassify hate speech if it doesn't contain any curse words or offensive terms.
