Instead of using the sinusoidal position embedding BIBREF13 and learned absolute position embedding, BIBREF17 argued that the distance between two tokens should be considered when calculating their attention score. BIBREF18 reduced the computation complexity of relative positional encoding from $O(l^2d)$ to $O(ld)$, where $l$ is the length of sequences and $d$ is the hidden size.

Therefore, by using $R_{t-j}$, the attention score can distinguish different directions and distances.", "The output of the multi-head attention will be further processed by the position-wise feed-forward networks, which can be represented as follows,", "The first is that the sinusoidal position embedding used in the vanilla Transformer is aware of distance but unaware of the directionality.

Besides, an entity is a continuous span of words. Therefore, the awareness of distance might help the word better recognizes its neighbor.

Human language is very ambiguous. Most words have multiple interpretations depending on the context in which they are mentioned. In the MT field, WSD techniques are concerned with finding the respective meaning and correct translation to these ambiguous words in target languages. This ambiguity problem was identified early in MT development. In 1960 Bar-Hillel BIBREF1 stated that an MT system is not able to find the right meaning without a specific knowledge. Although the ambiguity problem has been lessened significantly since the contribution of Carpuat and subsequent works BIBREF13 , this problem still remains a challenge. As seen in Moussallem et al. BIBREF6 , MT systems still try to resolve this problem by using domain specific language models to prefer domain specific expressions, but when translating a highly ambiguous sentence or a short text which covers multiple domains, the languages models are not enough.", "Although MT systems are now popular on the Web, they still generate a large number of incorrect translations.

According to research, the two main faults that are responsible for 40% and 30% of problems respectively, are reordering errors and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult.", "When an MT system does not recognize an entity, the translation output often has poor quality, immediately deteriorating the target text readability. Therefore, we suggest recognizing such entities before the translation process and first linking them to a reference knowledge base. Afterwards, the type of entities would be agglutinated along with their labels and their translations from a reference knowledge base. For instance, in NMT, the idea is to include in the training set for the aforementioned word \u201cKiwi\", \u201cKiwi.animal.link, Kiwi.person.link, Kiwi.food.link\" then finally to align them with the translations in the target text. For example, in SMT, the additional information can be included by XML or by an additional model. In contrast, in NMT, this additional information can be used as parameters in the training phase. This method would also contribute to OOV mistakes regarding names.

BIBREF17 decompose story generation into two steps, first converting text into event representations, then modeling stories as sequences of events before translating back to natural language. Similarly, BIBREF18 generate summaries of movies as sequences of events using an RNN, then sample event representations using MCMC.

People convicted of using hate speech can often face large fines and even imprisonment. These laws extend to the internet and social media, leading many sites to create their own provisions against hate speech. Both Facebook and Twitter have responded to criticism for not doing enough to prevent hate speech on their sites by instituting policies to prohibit the use of their platforms for attacks on people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, or threats of violence towards others.", "We extracted the time-line for each user, resulting in a set of 85.4 million tweets. From this corpus we then took a random sample of 25k tweets containing terms from the lexicon and had them manually coded by CrowdFlower (CF) workers. Workers were asked to label each tweet as one of three categories: hate speech, offensive but not hate speech, or neither offensive nor hate speech. They were provided with our definition along with a paragraph explaining it in further detail. Users were asked to think not just about the words appearing in a given tweet but about the context in which they were used. They were instructed that the presence of a particular word, however offensive, did not necessarily indicate a tweet is hate speech. Each tweet was coded by three or more people. The intercoder-agreement score provided by CF is 92%. We use the majority decision for each tweet to assign a label."]}

Why is this an important subject of study? Pragmatically, a reasonable cutoff point saves computational memory across fine-tuning multiple tasks, which bolsters the effectiveness of existing parameter-saving methods BIBREF5. Pedagogically, understanding the relationship between the number of fine-tuned layers and the resulting model quality may guide future works in modeling.", "From the reported results in Tables TABREF6\u2013TABREF9, fine-tuning the last output layer and task-specific layers is insufficient for all tasks\u2014see the rows corresponding to 0, 12, and 24 frozen layers. However, we find that the first half of the model is unnecessary; the base models, for example, need fine-tuning of only 3\u20135 layers out of the 12 to reach 90% of the original quality\u2014see Table TABREF7, middle subrow of each row group. Similarly, fine-tuning only a fourth of the layers is sufficient for the large models (see Table TABREF9); only 6 layers out of 24 for BERT and 7 for RoBERTa.", "An emerging line of work questions the need for such a parameter-loaded model, especially on a single downstream task. BIBREF3, for example, note that only a few attention heads need to be retained in each layer for acceptable effectiveness. BIBREF4 find that, on many tasks, just the last few layers change the most after the fine-tuning process. We take these observations as evidence that only the last few layers necessarily need to be fine-tuned.", "We report three relevant operating points in Tables TABREF6\u2013TABREF9: two extreme operating points and an intermediate one. The former is self-explanatory, indicating fine-tuning all or none of the nonoutput layers. The latter denotes the number of necessary layers for reaching at least 90% of the full model quality, excluding CoLA, which is an outlier.", "When every component except the output layer and the task-specific layer is frozen, the fine-tuned model achieves only 64% of the original quality, on average. As more layers are fine-tuned, the model effectiveness often improves drastically\u2014see CoLA and STS-B, the first and fourth vertical pairs of subfigures from the left. This demonstrates that gains decompose nonadditively with respect to the number of frozen initial layers. Fine-tuning subsequent layers shows diminishing returns, with every model rapidly approaching the baseline quality at fine-tuning half of the network; hence, we believe that half is a reasonable cutoff point for characterizing the models."]}
{"question_id": "441be93e2830cc0fc65afad6959db92754c9f5a8", "predicted_answer": "No, they do not test against the large version of RoBERTa due to computational limitations, except on the smaller datasets (CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, and STS-B).", "predicted_evidence": ["On each model, we freeze the embeddings and the weights of the first $N$ layers, then fine-tune the rest using the best hyperparameters of the full model. Specifically, if $L$ is the number of layers, we explore $N = \\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2} + 1, \\dots , L$. Due to computational limitations, we set half as the cutoff point. Additionally, we restrict our comprehensive all-datasets exploration to the base variant of BERT, since the large model variants and RoBERTa are much more computationally intensive. On the smaller CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, and STS-B datasets, we comprehensively evaluate both models. These choices do not substantially affect our analysis.", "Within each variant, the two models display slight variability in parameter count\u2014110 and 125 million in the base variant, and 335 and 355 in the large one. These differences are mostly attributed to RoBERTa using many more embedding parameters\u2014exactly 63% more for both variants. For in-depth, layerwise statistics, see Table TABREF4.", "Finally, for the large variants of BERT and RoBERTa on SST-2 (second subfigure from both the top and the left), we observe a surprisingly consistent increase in quality when freezing 12\u201316 layers. This finding suggests that these models may be overparameterized for SST-2.", "We choose BERT BIBREF0 and RoBERTa BIBREF2 as the subjects of our study, since they represent state of the art and the same architecture. XLNet BIBREF1 is another alternative; however, they use a slightly different attention structure, and our preliminary experiments encountered difficulties in reproducibility with the Transformers library. Each model has base and large variants that contain 12 and 24 layers, respectively. We denote them by appending the variant name as a subscript to the model name.", "Our fine-tuning procedure closely resembles those of BERT and RoBERTa. We choose the Adam optimizer BIBREF24 with a batch size of 16 and fine-tune BERT for 3 epochs and RoBERTa for 10, following the original papers. For hyperparameter tuning, the best learning rate is different for each task, and all of the original authors choose one between $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ and $5 \\times 10^{-5}$; thus, we perform line search over the interval with a step size of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$. We report the best results in Table TABREF5."]}
