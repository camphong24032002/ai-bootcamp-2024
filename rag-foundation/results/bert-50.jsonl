The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm.", "In contrast, we introduce new features to detect rumours as early as possible - preferably instantly, allowing them to be debunked before they spread and cause harm.", "al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours.

Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015). Although the computation of their features is efficient, the need for repeated mentions in the form of response by other users results in increased latency between publication and detection. The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours.

For example, failure and death describe concepts that are usually accompanied by sadness and thus they denote some amount of sadness.", "To test our model, we experiment using the training, validation and test datasets provided for the shared task BIBREF5 , which include tweets for four emotions: joy, sadness, fear, and anger.

Thus, the total correlation objective will attempt to group obesity and OSA-related terms together under a single latent factor.

Adding obesity as an anchor produces a clear Obesity topic, including several medications known to cause weight gain (e.g., acebutolol, klonopin). The anchored OSA topic, however, is quite poor and in fact resembles the rather generic topic to which obstructive sleep apnea is assigned by Unsupervised CorEx. It includes many spurious or non-specific terms like drug.", "There is a large body of work on integrating domain knowledge into topic models and other unsupervised latent variable models, often in the form of constraints BIBREF13 , prior distributions BIBREF14 , and token labels BIBREF15 .

An 80-20 data split is used for training and evaluation. Detailed performance of the CR is shown in Table 2 and 3. Additionally, we also implemented CR using spaCy BIBREF18 which also produced similar results.", "Using python tools such as PyPDF2, NLTK, and RegEx we build a pipeline to convert PDF to raw text along with extensive pre-processing which includes joining sentences that are split, removing URLs, shortening duplicate non-alpha characters, and replacing full forms of abbreviations with their shortened forms. We assume that the SE text is free of spelling errors. For the CR dataset, we select coherent paragraphs and full sentences by avoiding headers and short blurbs. Using domain keywords and a domain expert, we annotate roughly 3700 sentences at the word-token level. An example is shown in Figure 2 and the unique tag count is shown in Table 1.", "SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE ."]}

Although trained on the paraphrase database and having the highest INLINEFORM0 , the SL999 embedding could not outperform the Glove embedding in SICK-R. HCTI BIBREF5 , which is the current state-of-the-art in the group of neural representation models on STSB, also used the Glove embedding. However, the performance of HTCI in STSB ( INLINEFORM1 ) is lower than our model using the Glove embedding. In SICK-R, InferSent BIBREF23 achieves a strong performance ( INLINEFORM2 ) using the Glove embedding with transfer knowledge, while our model with only the Glove embedding achieves a performance close to the performance of InferSent.

Pre-training models have been used to obtain more effective word representations through the study of a large number of corpora. In the paradigm proposed in the original work by Devlin et al. BIBREF1 , the author directly trained BERT along with with a light-weighted task-specific head. In our case though, we top BERT with a more complex network structure, using Kaiming initialization BIBREF28 . If one would fine-tune directly the top models along with the weights in BERT, one is faced with the following dilemma: on the one hand, if the learning rate is too large, it is likely to disturb the structure innate to the pre-trained language models; on the other hand, if the learning rate is too small, since we top BERT with relatively complex models, the convergence of the top models might be impeded. Therefore, in the first phase we fix the weights in the pre-training language models, and only train the model on top of it.", "BIBREF0 , this allows us to achieve better results, at least on the selected tasks. More importantly, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of neural networks design, even in the presence of all-powerful pre-trained language models. Second, during the experiment, we have found that although simply using the proposed training strategy can result in higher accuracies compared to that of Peter et al. BIBREF0 , it is still a challenging task to find the appropriate methods to design and to utilize pre-trained networks. In this regard, we find that pre-trained models differ significantly from word embeddings in terms of their training strategies. Especially, since word embeddings can be viewed as shallow transfer learning, while pre-trained model should be viewed as deep transfer learning, one must try to combat over-fitting problems with more care due to the enormous number of parameters presented in the pre-trained models. Besides, we also find that in order to achieve the maximal performance in the post-pre-trained language model era, one must design, either manually or via Auto ML, networks that best fit the structure, especially the depth of the pre-trained language models."]}

This is essential due to the depth of the pre-trained language model. Second, this also means, one does not need explicitly to build extremely complex networks on top of pre-trained language models unless it complements the mechanisms of self-attention.

Unlike word embeddings, the pre-trained language models possess a large number of parameters compared to the task-specific models we build on top them. Therefore, if one were to train the top models until they reach the highest prediction accuracy in the training or validation data sets, it would likely cause the models to over-fit.

In the second tasks, we show that by ensembling different neural networks, one can even improve the accuracy of fine-tuning only methods even further. Finally, in the last task, we demonstrate that if one can tailor-made a neural network that specifically fit the characteristics of the pre-trained language models, one can improve the accuracy even further.

The latter denotes the number of necessary layers for reaching at least 90% of the full model quality, excluding CoLA, which is an outlier.", "An emerging line of work questions the need for such a parameter-loaded model, especially on a single downstream task. BIBREF3, for example, note that only a few attention heads need to be retained in each layer for acceptable effectiveness. BIBREF4 find that, on many tasks, just the last few layers change the most after the fine-tuning process. We take these observations as evidence that only the last few layers necessarily need to be fine-tuned."]}
{"question_id": "441be93e2830cc0fc65afad6959db92754c9f5a8", "predicted_answer": "", "predicted_evidence": ["We choose BERT BIBREF0 and RoBERTa BIBREF2 as the subjects of our study, since they represent state of the art and the same architecture. XLNet BIBREF1 is another alternative; however, they use a slightly different attention structure, and our preliminary experiments encountered difficulties in reproducibility with the Transformers library. Each model has base and large variants that contain 12 and 24 layers, respectively. We denote them by appending the variant name as a subscript to the model name.", "On each model, we freeze the embeddings and the weights of the first $N$ layers, then fine-tune the rest using the best hyperparameters of the full model. Specifically, if $L$ is the number of layers, we explore $N = \\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2} + 1, \\dots , L$. Due to computational limitations, we set half as the cutoff point. Additionally, we restrict our comprehensive all-datasets exploration to the base variant of BERT, since the large model variants and RoBERTa are much more computationally intensive. On the smaller CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, and STS-B datasets, we comprehensively evaluate both models. These choices do not substantially affect our analysis.", "Finally, for the large variants of BERT and RoBERTa on SST-2 (second subfigure from both the top and the left), we observe a surprisingly consistent increase in quality when freezing 12\u201316 layers. This finding suggests that these models may be overparameterized for SST-2.", "The central objective of our paper is, then, to determine how many of the last layers actually need fine-tuning. Why is this an important subject of study? Pragmatically, a reasonable cutoff point saves computational memory across fine-tuning multiple tasks, which bolsters the effectiveness of existing parameter-saving methods BIBREF5. Pedagogically, understanding the relationship between the number of fine-tuned layers and the resulting model quality may guide future works in modeling.", "Within each variant, the two models display slight variability in parameter count\u2014110 and 125 million in the base variant, and 335 and 355 in the large one. These differences are mostly attributed to RoBERTa using many more embedding parameters\u2014exactly 63% more for both variants. For in-depth, layerwise statistics, see Table TABREF4."]}
